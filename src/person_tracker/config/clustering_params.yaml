    # Frame configuration
    map_frame: "map"  # Fixed reference frame for velocity calculation (independent of robot movement)

    # Tracking parameters
    max_tracking_distance: 1.5      # Max distance (m) for associating detections to tracks
    max_missing_frames: 10          # Remove track after this many missing detections
    velocity_history_size: 5        # Number of velocity samples for smoothing
    position_history_size: 10       # Number of position samples for velocity calculation
    min_speed_threshold: 0.05       # Ignore speeds below this (m/s) - noise filtering
    max_speed_threshold: 3.0        # Cap speeds above this (m/s) - outlier rejection
    smoothing_alpha: 0.3            # Exponential smoothing factor (0-1, higher = more responsive)

    # Clustering parameters
    cluster_distance_threshold: 1.2  # Max distance (m) between people in same cluster
    publish_singletons: true         # Whether to publish clusters of size 1 (isolated people)
