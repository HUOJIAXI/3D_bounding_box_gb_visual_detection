# Person Speed Tracker Configuration

person_speed_tracker:
  ros__parameters:
    # Tracking parameters
    max_tracking_distance: 1.5  # Maximum distance (m) to associate detections with existing tracks
    max_missing_frames: 10      # Maximum number of frames a person can be missing before removal

    # Velocity calculation parameters
    velocity_history_size: 5    # Number of velocity samples to keep for smoothing
    position_history_size: 10   # Number of position samples to keep for calculation
    smoothing_alpha: 0.3        # Exponential smoothing factor (0.0 to 1.0, higher = more responsive)

    # Speed filtering parameters
    min_speed_threshold: 0.05   # Minimum speed (m/s) to report (noise filtering)
    max_speed_threshold: 3.0    # Maximum speed (m/s) to report (outlier rejection)
